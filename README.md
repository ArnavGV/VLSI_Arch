# VLSI_Arch
Labs of MEL G642 (VLSI Architecture), a higher degree chip design course

## Lab 1
Basics of Verilog HDL, task is to test functions of each verilog operator and display its results

## Lab 2
Focused on efficient adders, task is to design 16,32 and 64 bit signed and unsigned Ripple Carry Adders, a 32 bit signed Redundant Carry Adder, a 64 bit heirarchical Carry Lookahead Adder.  Then synthesise and compare LUTs, Power consumed and Delay

## Lab 3
Focused on 32 bit general purpose combinatorial shifter with left/right arithmetic/logical shift operations. Synthesis and record of LUTs, Power consumed and Delay

## Lab 4
Design a Moore FSM controller to control the appliances for room comfort as per specifications, given inputs that are sensitive to temperature change. Then syntheize it for Xilinx FPGA (XC7Z020 CLG484-1) and characterize performance, complexity, delay and power.

## Lab 5
Simulate the CORDIC algorithm for 16 iterations and track convergence

## MINi Project (Lab 6)
Simulate a CISC processor - MIN - as modelled in Nick Tredennick's Microprocesor Logic Design. And run a simple program to load values from memory, operate on them and store them back.

## Lab 7
Add a custom instruction to sum all elements in an array. Flowcharts created and control words added to MIN Processor

## Lab 8
Simulate Execute stage of a 5 stage RISC V pipelined processor. ISA: RV32I

## Lab 9
Simulate MEM stage of a 5 stage RISC V pipelined processor. ISA: RV32I
