# VLSI_Arch
Labs of MEL G642 (VLSI Architecture), a higher degree chip design course

## Lab 1
Basics of Verilog HDL, task is to test functions of each verilog operator and display its results

## Lab 2
Focused on efficient adders, task is to design 16,32 and 64 bit signed and unsigned Ripple Carry Adders, a 32 bit signed Redundant Carry Adder, a 64 bit heirarchical Carry Lookahead Adder.  Then synthesise and compare LUTs, Power consumed and Delay

## Lab 3
Focused on 32 bit general purpose combinatorial shifter with left/right arithmetic/logical shift operations. Synthesis and record of LUTs, Power consumed and Delay
